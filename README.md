Problem Statement:

The goal of this analysis was to derive insights from an e-commerce company's sales data. The aim was to explore customer purchasing patterns, identify high-performing product categories, analyze year-over-year sales growth, calculate retention rates, and assess customer behavior over time. These insights can help improve the company's strategy, optimize marketing efforts, and enhance the customer experience.

What I Did:
Firstly I cleaned the data and modified some columns where needed. Then-

1. Customer Order Analysis:

Moving Average for Customer Orders: Calculated the moving average of customer orders over time to smooth out fluctuations and identify trends in customer purchasing behavior.

Cumulative Sales per Month: Aggregated and plotted total sales per month to track overall performance and seasonal trends.

Year-over-Year Growth in Sales: Analyzed the year-over-year sales growth to assess overall business growth and identify key periods of improvement or decline.

2. Sales Analysis by Category:

Total Sales by Category: Calculated the total sales for each product category and visualized the results to identify which categories contribute most to overall revenue.

Percentage of Orders Paid in Installments: Analyzed the percentage of orders paid in installments to understand customer financing behavior.

Revenue Contribution by Product Category: Identified the percentage contribution of each product category to the total revenue.

3. Customer Demographics and Retention:

State-wise Customer Distribution: Calculated and displayed the number of customers from each state to understand geographic distribution and target regional marketing efforts.

Customer Retention Rate: Analyzed the retention rate of customers who made repeat purchases within six months.

4. Top-Spending Customers and Sellers:

Top-Spending Customers: Identified the top 3 customers who spent the most each year and visualized their spending trends.

Revenue by Sellers: Calculated the total revenue generated by each seller, ranking them accordingly to identify high-performing sellers.

5. Correlation and Insights:

Correlation Between Product Price and Frequency of Purchase: Analyzed the relationship between product price and the number of times a product was purchased, identifying high-demand products.

Average Number of Products per Customer by City: Calculated and plotted the average number of products per customer, segmented by customer city.

6. Visualizations:

Created various plots including line charts, bar charts, and histograms to visualize trends, distributions, and comparisons between different variables.

Tools Used:

Python: Used as the primary programming language for data manipulation and analysis.

Pandas: Used for data cleaning, transformation, and aggregating sales and customer data.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Used for data visualization to create insightful and clear charts (e.g., line plots for trends, bar plots for category analysis).

Jupyter Notebook: Utilized for code execution, data analysis, and interactive visualizations.

Recommendations:

1. Increase Marketing Focus on High-Performing Categories:

Product categories that contribute significantly to total sales should be targeted for further promotional activities. Analyzing customer behavior within these categories can yield targeted strategies to boost sales.

2. Improve Customer Retention Efforts:

Given the retention rate analysis, the company should focus on retaining high-value customers by offering loyalty programs, discounts, or incentives for repeat purchases.

Analyzing customer segments that show higher retention can help personalize offers and promotions.

3. Leverage Installment Payment Insights:

Products that are frequently paid for in installments may indicate that customers prefer flexible payment options. Offering installment payment options could further drive sales, especially for higher-priced items.

4. Geographic Marketing:

With customers distributed across various states, targeted regional marketing can help optimize ad spend and improve customer engagement in specific areas where the company is more popular.

5. Focus on High-Performing Sellers:

Identifying and promoting top-performing sellers can help increase revenue further. The company may also consider providing incentives to sellers with high revenue potential to further boost sales.

Conclusion:

This comprehensive analysis of the e-commerce sales data provides valuable insights into customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends. By focusing on high-performing product categories, improving retention efforts, and leveraging installment payment options, the company can enhance its overall strategy and drive future growth. Additionally, regional marketing and seller performance analysis offer opportunities to further optimize sales channels and improve customer satisfaction.
